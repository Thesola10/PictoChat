issue or a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Your contributions should follow the [Linux Kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html).
   If it works for them, it will work for us.
2. Ensure the project can be built and remains compatible with the original API. If it is not, you will
   need to open an issue and update relevant documentation.
3. All unit tests should come out as successful. If you made changes to unit tests, you will need to open
   an issue.
4. Run the hardware tests with a working Prism54 WiFi adapter and Nintendo DS/DSi. You may test on a 3DS
   if it was modified to install PictoChat on it.
   
<!-- TODO: Once #2 is closed, document the aforementioned hardware tests. -->
